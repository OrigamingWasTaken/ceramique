# Core Files

These files make the bot work. If you modify them, it will be harder to receive updates from the template.

# The how do I make some changes?

If your change is a bug fix, or a feature, then make a pull request on the template (https://github.com/OrigamingWasTaken/discord-dev-env.git)
Otherwise, you can move on and modify the core files.
